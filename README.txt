UCLA Directory

Recently I was accepted into UCLA for the Spring 2019 quarter to study Digital Communications Systems. I'm now a bandwagoner... go Bruins!

But, I wanted to finish my master's degree in a minimum amount of time while accumulating the most knowledge. Academic planning can also be a pain so I wanted to develop a python script to help me and my friends generate a schedule going to 2021 and be reliant on course-schedule1.xlsx to filter and automate the decision making process. This will help us filter out schedules to depict what we really want to learn by seeing our possible options.

UCLA program has some constraints shown in their following directory:
https://www.msol.ucla.edu/signal-processing-and-communications/
https://www.msol.ucla.edu/electrical-engineering-certificate/
https://www.msol.ucla.edu/integrated-circuits/

The constraints for graduation are twofold:
1) Finish 9 courses of which...
	-5 classes are of graduate study
	-You complete comprehensive exam requirements: either 3 written exams OR the ENGR 299 capstone program
	-6 classes are under your accepted field of study (electives can fill in the rest)
2) You may not take more than 3 years (excluding summer). Many students usually finish in 2 academic years + 1 extra quarter to use as a baseline.

The output of this algorithm will be a file containing time lined class schedule with one class per quarter including summer sessions. This project will be completed in python.
